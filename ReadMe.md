# Learning Java Basics 
### This repository holds codes  in companion with taught class sessions to help trainees acquire the best foundation for *Java* programming 

Before we begin, there are a few things to note
In java most of the code we are going to write will be within a class
Even though classes are covered as the last part of this coursework,
for now just know that most of the codes will need to be in a class

to show output, we are going to use  System.out.println function
to print the results of our code on the terminal

This code was developed using IntelliJ IDEA
The code is structured subtropical by use of packages, 
something you do  not also need to worry about, you will be familiar with packages 
later on. 
if you are using any other software you will need to know how to run java code
Here in IntelliJ IDEA to run java code just press the play button

#### *Some codes will not be easy to grasp without the help of a trainer*

        Because the string is a reference type,
        it kind of inherits from the String class prebuilt in Java.
        so it gives access to methods that aid us to perform many functionalities on s string
        We can use the charAt method and input an index to extract that character from the string
        e.g. extract studentFirstInitial and studentLastInitial from the studentFirstName and studentLastName respectively
        NOTE: indices start at zero

        We join strings by using the  + symbol - an operation called concatenation in programming
        which is simply adding one string to another to come up with a sentence or something of sorts

        /*
        To know how many characters are in the string you can call the .length()  method
        get the length of the sentence generated above

        whenever you need to know the index of any character in a string you can use the .indexOf method
